# Reading this Pipeline

* This pipeline is an equivalent of gemfire-develop-main pipeline that existed before.
* This pipeline is responsible to sync the apache/geode:develop to gemfire/geode-support:develop
* This pipeline is also responsible for creating the artifacts for gemfire(geode-support) and updating the passing tokens for the subsequent pipelines(gemfire-assembly)
